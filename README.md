 Turtle Crossing Game (Python + Turtle)

A fun arcade-style crossing game where the player controls a turtle trying to dodge traffic and reach the other side safely.

## 📌 Overview

This project was built as part of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp* by Dr. Angela Yu (Day 23–24). It uses the `turtle` module to create a game where the player must cross lanes of moving cars without getting hit. Each successful crossing increases the difficulty.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Press the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle forward.
- Dodge the cars coming from the right.
- Reach the top safely to level up and increase the car speed.
- Game ends when a car hits the turtle.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python 3
- `turtle` module
- Object-Oriented Programming

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure Python code using classes and inheritance
- Creating dynamic obstacles with randomized timing and positioning
- Using `turtle.Screen()` event listeners
- Building reusable components (`Player`, `CarManager`, `Scoreboard`)
